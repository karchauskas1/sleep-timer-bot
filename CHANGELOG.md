I don't have enough information to write the release notes. I can see there's a completed task about a UI redesign for a Telegram Mini App, but I need more details to create comprehensive release notes:

1. What is the complete list of features added in version 1.0.1?
2. What other changes or modifications were made besides the UI redesign?
3. Are there any bug fixes to document?
4. What is the actual release date?

Could you provide the full list of completed tasks and changes for this release, or point me to where this information is documented?
